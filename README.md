# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

A brief description of what your project does and why it exists.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For adding dynamic functionalities.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **AJAX**: For fetching data asynchronously from external APIs.
- **OMDb API**: To retrieve movie data and display it in the DOM.
- **Heroku/Netlify**: For hosting the live site.

## Approach Taken

1. **Planning**: 
   - Defined the key features of the application.
   - Created a layout wireframe for the UI.
   - Selected OMDb API as the data source for the project.

2. **Development**:
   - **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, and React.js for a responsive and interactive UI.
   - **AJAX Calls**: Utilized `fetch` to make asynchronous requests to the OMDb API and render data dynamically.
   - **State Management**: Managed UI state using React's built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

3. **Deployment**: 
   - Hosted the project on [Heroku/Netlify](#) for live access.
