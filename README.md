This application, MovieMap, is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT providing an interactive platform for movie searches. It is hosted on Heroku and utilizes AJAX to fetch real-time movie data from the OMDB API, dynamically displaying the information in the user interface. The project is actively maintained with frequent commits to GitHub and includes comprehensive documentation for users.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For adding dynamic functionalities.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **AJAX**: For fetching data asynchronously from external APIs.
- **OMDb API**: To retrieve movie data and display it in the DOM.
- **Heroku/Netlify**: For hosting the live site.

## Approach Taken

1. **Planning**: 
   - Determined the key features of the application.
   - Created a layout wireframe for the UI.
   - Selected OMDb API as the data source for the project.

2. **Development**:
   - **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, and React.js for a responsive and interactive UI.
   - **AJAX Calls**: Utilized `fetch` to make asynchronous requests to the OMDb API and render data dynamically.
   - **State Management**: Managed UI state using React's built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

3. **Deployment**: 
   - Hosted the project on [Heroku](#) for live access.
